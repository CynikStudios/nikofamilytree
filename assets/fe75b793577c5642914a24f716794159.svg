Although I wanted to do</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">more than the minimum in the choice board, this project took a</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">long time to make, so I would most likely not get it done in that</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">case. My family tree on my dad's side is all from Georgia, with</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">my dad being the only current US ancestor on his side (as far as</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">I know). Some cities some of those ancestors were born in were</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">Tbilisi, Chiatura, and a bunch of the small villages on the</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">mountains, such as the one my grandmother currently lives in,</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">Tskhrukveti. My mother's side had miles of hints and records to</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">base off of, so research was way easier. For the most part, my </tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">maternal-maternal side is from Liebenthal and Herzog</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">Russia, and my maternal-paternal side is from Canada</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">(specifically Quebec) and even goes back to France (specifically</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">Bourgogne). This was a super fun project, and it was especially</tspan><tspan x="0" dy="48px">interesting to see the roots of my mom.</tspan></text></g></g></svg>
